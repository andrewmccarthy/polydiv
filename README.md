# Polydivisible number calculator

## Explanation

In base 10, using the non-zero digits (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) can you
arrange the numbers so that

- the first digit is divisible by one (not hard)
- the first two digits taken as a number are divisible by two
- the first three digits taken as a number are divisible by three

...
- All nine digits are divisible by nine.

The single answer for base 10 is 381654729.

This quick script calculates the solutions for any base specified on the
command-line. It requires [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) only because I'm too
lazy to write my own version of
[`numpy.base_repr`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.base_repr.html).

*Update* â€”  I've translated the Python into C (using the [GNU Multiple
Precision Arithmetic Library](https://gmplib.org/)). The initial C version was
6 times faster than the very-unoptimised Python.  Some simple optimisations
made it about 49 times faster than Python.

## Output

For each base, the output shows a list of numbers, first in the given base, and
secondly in base ten. For bases higher than 36, the first value is not converted
and replaced with an asterisk

## Inspiration

I'd written a program to solve this about 25 or more years ago in PET Basic on
the Commodore 64, but to solve it in bases other than ten was suggested by Matt
Parker's recent book [Things to Make and Do in the Fourth
Dimension](http://makeanddo4d.com/).

## Solutions

Unless my script is broken, here's the output of `./polydiv.py {2..30}` to save
you wasting time.
